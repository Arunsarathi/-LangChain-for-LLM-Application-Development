# Model Prompt Parsing with Chains and Agents

## Overview
This repository is designed for building and testing a model prompt parser that incorporates memory management, question-answering (QnA), and chain-of-thought processing. The project leverages various notebooks for each stage of the process, allowing modular development and evaluation.

## Files in the Repository
Here is a breakdown of the files in the repository:

- **L1-Model_prompt_parser.ipynb**: This notebook handles the parsing of input prompts and is the starting point for the model.
- **L2-Memory.ipynb**: This notebook manages memory, allowing the model to remember previous interactions and optimize future responses.
- **L3-chains.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on chain-of-thought processing to guide the model through complex queries in a structured manner.
- **L4-QnA.ipynb**: This notebook deals with question-answering functionalities, enabling the model to respond accurately to user queries.
- **L5-Evaluation.ipynb**: This notebook provides tools for evaluating model performance across various dimensions.
- **L6-Agents.ipynb**: This notebook deals with agent-based architectures for modular and distributed model control.

## Installation
To run the notebooks locally, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
